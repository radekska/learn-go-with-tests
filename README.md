# learn-go-with-tests

Just learning Go with TDD here. Inspired by [learn-go-with-tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/)

You will find here some micro toy projects in each folder with corresponding unit tests.

To run test for single section simply execute:

```shell
make test package=<package-name>
```

To run all:
```shell
make tests
```

To run benchmarks:
```shell
make benchmarks
```
